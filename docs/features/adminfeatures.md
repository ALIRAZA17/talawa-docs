## Overall Guidance

We will assume that at least one person in the organization has access to a traditional computer device with a non-mobile size screen to help them do administrative tasks via the portal.

Administrators will also need to be able to do some portal tasks from their phones such as:

1. Sending organization wide messages
2. Creating organizational events
3. Adding Co-ordinators
