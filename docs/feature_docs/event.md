## Feature EVT001: Group personal events vs organization wide events

_Authored by_ _ **Shannika Jackson** _ _Last updated on_ _ **March 13, 2021** _

This feature aims to_ **improve the event viewing options** _ by _ **allowing users to group different types of events** _.

## Overview

### Problem

1. **All events in the organisation is currently displayed ungrouped :** Ideally, the user should be able to
  1. Toggle between their subscribed events or all events in the organization

### Goals

1. **Provide a more streamlined event display :** This should allow modularity for feature development in event management

### Out of Scope

The following are aspects of this feature which have been considered but are outside of the scope for the current project:

1. **Tag events :** This will eventually allow a user to subscribe to, toggle display of and get notifications for specific types of events
2. **Toggle personal event view, co-ordinator, organization and all views on calendar :** This will allow the user to switch between the different views based on their roles.

### People and Roles

The following are the primary roles foreseen in the development of this feature

1. **Feature Lead** : will review proposed solutions, acceptance and close feature .

## Context

NA

### Use Cases

1. **Members want to:**
  1. **Toggle the view of their events** between their subscribed events and all events in the organisation for which they have permission to view (public events and private ones they have been accepted to).
2. **Admins want to** :
  1. **Toggle view of all events** between public or private
  2. **View all members&#39; personal events**
3. Coordinators want to:
  1. **Toggle view of their events:** between their coordinated events and all organization&#39;s events.

## Proposal/Solution

### User Experience

1. From the home screen users should be presented with a button to view events.
2. This view defaults to display all events for which the user is subscribed.
3. The user should be presented with the option to toggle between viewing all events, only their subscribed events and only their coordinated events.

## Context

### Use Cases

1. **Admins want to** :

## Proposal/Solution

### User Experience

**Promote members to coordinators:**

1. From the admin portal on the web client or the mobile app, an administrator must be able to view a list of members in an organization
  1. A menu or option button must be presented to the administrator in order to perform additional actions to the member account/ profile.
  2. From this menu the administrator must be presented with the option to promote the member to a coordinator.
  3. Once this is selected and the changes committed, the newly created coordinator must be able to perform the tasks of a coordinator

**Removing inappropriate posts:**

1. From the mobile app or the web client a coordinator or an admin show see additional options for each post.
  1. They should be able to select remove post from these additional options
  2. The post must then be removed from the news feed of all members and a message sent to the author of the post that is was removed

**Assigning members to event tasks:**

1. From events detail view or the create event view a coordinator or an admin user must be presented with the option to create task list
2. Once the create task list option is selected, the user is prompted to enter basic details for the task eg. print flyers
  1. Additionally the user must be presented with the option to assign the task to a member
  2. Once this option is selected a list of the members in the organisation or the groups are presented with muli-select option
  3. After selecting the members or groups to assign to the tasks the user should be able to commit their changes and is redirected to the task detail where the users assigned to the task are displayed
  4. The option must also be available to remove an assigned member or group from the task and commit the changes
